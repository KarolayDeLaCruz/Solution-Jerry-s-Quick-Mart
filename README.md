# Solution-Jerry-s-Quick-Mart

## Explanation 
- My proposal is entirely in Python.
- The user has a menu with 6 options to manipulate the cart and update the data.
- It was made with a main class called Transactions with 7 instances that has the basic functionalities that Jerri's Quick Mart needs.
- Cart and transaction data is managed as a dataframe with help of pandas library.
- When selecting option 5 (checkout) inventory is updated only on the program not in the txt file.
- When selecting option 5 (checkout) transaction is saved in a text file in the folder location.
- Transaction number for receipt is assigned as a random number between 000000-999999.
